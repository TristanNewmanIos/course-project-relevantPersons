# course-project-relevantPersons
Showcases my ability to create and manage: components, state, handlers, class, and more.

This is assuming you have started an application using terminal and npm before.

Download the source code and open it with your favorite text editor. I prefer Atom.

If you would just like to see the application as it would appear in a web browser, you may download the complete app folder "complete-react-guide", change directory to that folder, and start the application.

  Use the "toggle persons" button to show/ hide people, 
  click a person to remove them from the list, 
  click "Show Persons" to only show a person, 
  with Persons showing click "Login" to show login depedant content, 
  delete 1 or 2 persons to change the persons "alert", 
  type in the text entry field to change the name of a person
  
 Stay tuned for more features I'm capable of making over time.
